# Final - SI 364 W18 // Sadie Staudacher - sadies


## Description
Welcome to my SI364 Final project!
This application uses the Spotify API in order for you to create an account and view Spotify playlists. On here you are able to search for playlists, view their songs, and create reviews for the playlists that others can see. You can also create an account as well as update and delete your own reviews. However, you are only able to create and update/delete your own reviews.

## To Use the App
Without being logged in, you can still search for playlist, view the songs, and see what other people have said (unless there is no review). You cannot leave reviews or see all that have been left without logging in. After logging in, you are then able to view all reviews and leave your own!


## To note
* No additional modules were installed (except for ones that were required for this class) for the application.
* In order to use this application, I had to create an an oauth key for myself and created a variable for it. This expires frequently and you will need to go to `https://beta.developer.spotify.com/console/get-search-item/?q=&type=&market=&limit=&offset=` in order to use this on your device. After obtaining the key, substitute it on line 42.
* Database name: SI364finalSADIES

* `http://localhost:5000/all_users` -> `all_users.html`


### Code requirements
* **Ensure that your SI364final.py file has all the setup ( app.config values, import statements, code to run the app if that file is run, etc) necessary to run the Flask application, and the application runs correctly on http://localhost:5000 (and the
other routes you set up). Your main file must be called SI364final.py , but of
course you may include other files if you need.**
* **A user should be able to load http://localhost:5000 and see the first page they
ought to see on the application.**
* **Include navigation in base.html with links (using a href tags) that lead to every
other page in the application that a user should be able to click on. (e.g. in the
lecture examples from the Feb 9 lecture, like this )**
* **Ensure that all templates in the application inherit (using template inheritance,
with extends ) from base.html and include at least one additional block .**
* **Must use user authentication (which should be based on the code you were
provided to do this e.g. in HW4).**
* **Must have data associated with a user and at least 2 routes besides logout that
can only be seen by logged-in users.**
* **At least 3 model classes besides the User class.**
* **At least one one:many relationship that works properly built between 2 models.**
* **At least one many:many relationship that works properly built between 2 models.**
* **Successfully save data to each table.**
* **Successfully query data from each of your models (so query at least one
column, or all data, from every database table you have a model for) and use it to
effect in the application (e.g. won't count if you make a query that has no effect
on what you see, what is saved, or anything that happens in the app).**
* **At least one query of data using an .all() method and send the results of that
query to a template.**
* **At least one query of data using a .filter_by(... and show the results of that
query directly (e.g. by sending the results to a template) or indirectly (e.g. using
the results of the query to make a request to an API or save other data to a
table).**
* **At least one helper function that is not a get_or_create function should be
defined and invoked in the application.**
* **At least two get_or_create functions should be defined and invoked in the application (such that information can be saved without being duplicated / encountering errors).**
* **At least one error handler for a 404 error and a corresponding template.**
* **At least one error handler for any other error (pick one -- 500? 403?) and a
corresponding template.**
* **Include at least 4 template .html files in addition to the error handling template
files.**
  * **At least one Jinja template for loop**
  * **and at least two Jinja template conditionals should occur amongst the templates.**
* **At least one request to a REST API that is based on data submitted in a WTForm OR data accessed in another way online (e.g. scraping with
BeautifulSoup that does accord with other involved sites' Terms of Service, etc).**
  * **Your application should use data from a REST API or other source such
that the application processes the data in some way and saves some
information that came from the source to the database (in some way).**
* At least one WTForm that sends data with a GET request to a new page.
* **At least one WTForm that sends data with a POST request to the same page.
(NOT counting the login or registration forms provided for you in class.)**
* **At least one WTForm that sends data with a POST request to a new page. (NOT
counting the login or registration forms provided for you in class.)**
* **At least two custom validators for a field in a WTForm, NOT counting the custom
validators included in the log in/auth code.**
* **Include at least one way to update items saved in the database in the application
(like in HW5).**
* **Include at least one way to delete items saved in the database in the application
(also like in HW5).**
* **Include at least one use of redirect .**
* **Include at least two uses of url_for . (HINT: Likely you'll need to use this several
times, really.)**
* **Have at least 5 view functions that are not included with the code we have
provided. (But you may have more! Make sure you include ALL view functions in the app in the documentation and navigation as instructed above**

### Additional Requirements
* (100 points) Include a use of an AJAX request in your application that accesses
and displays useful (for use of your application) data.
* **(100 points) Create, run, and commit at least one migration.**
* (100 points) Include file upload in your application and save/use the results of
the file. (We did not explicitly learn this in class, but there is information available
about it both online and in the Grinberg book.)
* (100 points) Deploy the application to the internet (Heroku) — only counts if it is
up when we grade / you can show proof it is up at a URL and tell us what the
URL is in the README. (Heroku deployment as we taught you is 100% free so
this will not cost anything.)
* (100 points) Implement user sign-in with OAuth (from any other service), and
include that you need a specific-service account in the README, in the same
section as the list of modules that must be installed.
